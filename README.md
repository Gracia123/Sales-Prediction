The goal is to analyze the Rossmann sales data (Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data) using predictive models such as linear regression and KNN regression. The dataset used in this paper is the Rossmann Store Sales which available on Kaggle. Rossmann is a German drugstore chain (second largest in the country). Under approximately 3,466 stores operate under them in six different European countries.

Data preprocessing is a was done by using data mining techniques such as feature selection -  thus finding the attributes that are the most meaningful and extracting useful information from it while discarding/dropping the rest of the features.

Modelled the dataset using Linear and KNN regression to predict sales. Evaluating the model using statistical methods like RMSE, MAPE and Regression score. The results are used in understanding which is a more suitable classifier for sales prediction.

For the Rossman dataset, Linear Regression is a better model as testing and training errors for RMSE and MAPE are lesser i.e. the difference between training and testing error is lesser for Linear regression when compared to KNN Regression.
